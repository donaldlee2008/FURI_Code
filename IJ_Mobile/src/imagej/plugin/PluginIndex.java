/**
 * Data structure for managing registered plugins.
 * <p>
 * The plugin index is a special type of {@link imagej.object.ObjectIndex} that
 * classifies each {@link PluginInfo} object into a type hierarchy compatible
 * with its associated <em>plugin</em> type (i.e.,
 * {@link PluginInfo#getPluginType()}), rather than {@link PluginInfo}'s type
 * hierarchy (i.e., {@link PluginInfo}, {@link imagej.UIDetails},
 * {@link imagej.Instantiable}, etc.).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: This type hierarchy will typically <em>not</em> include the plugin class
 * itself; for example, the {@code imagej.core.plugins.app.AboutImageJ} command
 * has a plugin type of {@link imagej.command.Command}, and hence will be
 * categorized beneath {@code Command.class}, not {@code AboutImageJ.class}. The
 * rationale is that to fully classify each plugin including its own class, said
 * class would need to be loaded, which ImageJ makes an effort not to do until
 * the plugin is actually executed for the first time.
