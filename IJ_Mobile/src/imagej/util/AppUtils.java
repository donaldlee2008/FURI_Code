	/**
	 * Gets the base file system directory from the given known class location.
	 * <p>
	 * This method uses heuristics to find the base directory in a variety of
	 * situations. Depending on your execution environment, the class may be
	 * located in one of several different places:
	 * </p>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>In the Maven build directory.</b> Typically this is the
	 * {@code target/classes} folder of a given component. In this case, the class
	 * files reside directly on the file system (not in a JAR file). The base
	 * directory is defined as the toplevel Maven directory for the multi-module
	 * project. For example, if you have checked out {@code imagej.git} to
	 * {@code ~/code/imagej}, the {@code imagej.ImageJ} class will be located at
	 * {@code ~/code/imagej/core/core/target/classes/imagej/ImageJ.class}. Asking
	 * for the base directory for that class will yield {@code ~/code/imagej}, as
	 * long as you correctly specify {@code core/core} for the
	 * {@code  baseSubdirectory}.</li>
	 * <li><b>Within a JAR file in the Maven local repository cache.</b> Typically
	 * this cache is located in {@code ~/.m2/repository}. The location will be
	 * {@code groupId/artifactId/version/artifactId-version.jar} where
	 * {@code groupId}, {@code artifactId} and {@code version} are the <a
	 * href="http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates">Maven GAV
	 * coordinates</a>. Note that in this case, no base directory with respect to
	 * the given class can be found, and this method will return null.</li>
	 * <li><b>Within a JAR file beneath the base directory.</b> Common cases
	 * include running the application from a standalone application bundle (e.g.,
	 * the JARs may all be located within a {@code jars} folder of the application
	 * distribution archive) or using a JAR packaged by Maven and residing in the
	 * Maven build folder (typically {@code target/artifactId-version.jar}).
	 * However, this could potentially be anywhere beneath the base directory.
	 * This method assumes the JAR will be nested exactly one level deep; i.e., it
	 * computes the base directory as the parent directory of the one containing
	 * the JAR file.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * <p>
	 * As you can see, it is quite complicated to find the base directory properly
	 * in all cases. The specific execution environments we have tested include:
	 * </p>
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>Running from Eclipse.</b> How Eclipse structures the classpath
	 * depends on which dependencies are open (i.e., project dependencies) versus
	 * closed (i.e., JAR dependencies). Each project dependency has a classpath
	 * entry <b>in its Maven build directory</b>. Each JAR dependency has a
	 * classpath entry <b>within a JAR file in the Maven local repository
	 * cache</b>.</li>
	 * <li><b>Running via Maven.</b> If you execute the application using Maven
	 * (e.g., {@code mvn exec:exec}, or with a fully Maven-compatible IDE such as
	 * NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA) then all dependencies will reside <b>within JAR
	 * files in the local Maven repository cache</b>. But the executed project
	 * itself will reside <b>in its Maven build directory</b>. So as long as you
	 * ask for the base directory relative to a class
	 * <em>of the executed project</em> it will be found.</li>
	 * <li><b>Running the ImageJ application bundle.</b> Typically this means
	 * downloading ImageJ from the web site, unpacking it and running the ImageJ
	 * launcher (double-clicking ImageJ-win32.exe on Windows, double-clicking the
	 * {@code ImageJ.app} on OS X, etc.). In this case, all components reside in
	 * the {@code jars} folder of the application bundle, and the base directory
	 * will be found one level above that.</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * 
	 * @param classLocation The location from which the base directory should be
	 *          derived.
	 * @param baseSubdirectory A hint for what to expect for a directory structure
	 *          beneath the application base directory. If this value is null
	 *          (i.e., no hint is given), the heuristic scans up the directory
	 *          tree looking for the topmost pom.xml file.
