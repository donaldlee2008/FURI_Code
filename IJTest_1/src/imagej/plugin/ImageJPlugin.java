/**
 * Top-level interface for plugins. Plugins discoverable at runtime must
 * implement this interface and be annotated with @{@link Plugin}.
 * <p>
 * The core types of plugins are as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Command} - plugins that are executable as {@link Module}s. These
 * plugins typically perform a discrete operation, and are accessible via the
 * ImageJ menus.</li>
 * <li>{@link Service} - plugins that define new API in a particular area.</li>
 * <li>{@link Tool} - plugins that map user input (e.g., keyboard and mouse
 * actions) to behavior. They are usually rendered as icons in the ImageJ
 * toolbar.</li>
 * <li>{@link Display} - plugins that visualize objects, often used to display
 * module outputs.</li>
 * <li>{@link InputWidget} - plugins that render UI widgets for the
 * {@link InputHarvester} preprocessor.</li>
 * <li>{@link PreprocessorPlugin} - plugins that perform preprocessing on
 * modules. A {@link PreprocessorPlugin} is a discoverable
 * {@link ModulePreprocessor}.</li>
 * <li>{@link PostprocessorPlugin} - plugins that perform postprocessing on
 * modules. A {@link PostprocessorPlugin} is a discoverable
 * {@link ModulePostprocessor}.</li>
 * <li>{@link Platform} - plugins for defining platform-specific behavior.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * What all plugins have in common is that they are declared using an annotation
 * (@{@link Plugin}), and discovered if present on the classpath at runtime.
 * </p>
