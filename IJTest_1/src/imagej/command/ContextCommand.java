/**
 * A command that knows its context. Its service parameters are automatically
 * populated at construction, to make it easier to use via Java API calls (i.e.,
 * without invoking it via {@link CommandService#run}). This improves
 * compile-time safety of downstream code that calls the command.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example command execution using {@link CommandService#run}:
 * </p>
 * {@code
 * Future<CommandModule<FindEdges>> future =
 *   commandService.run(findEdges.class, "display", myDisplay);
 * CommandModule<FindEdges> module = future.get(); // block till complete
 * ImageDisplay outDisplay = (ImageDisplay) module.getOutput("display");
 * }
 * <p>
 * Note that {@code FindEdges} also has two other inputs, an
 * {@code ImageDisplayService} and an {@code OverlayService}, which get
 * automatically populated by the {@link ServicePreprocessor}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here is the same command execution via direct Java calls:
 * </p>
 * {@code
 * FindEdges findEdges = new FindEdges();
 * findEdges.setContext(context); // populates service parameters
 * findEdges.setDisplay(myDisplay);
 * findEdges.run(); // execute on the same thread
 * ImageDisplay outDisplay = findEdges.getDisplay();
 * }
 * <p>
 * We believe the latter is more intuitive for most Java programmers, and so
 * encourage commands to extend this class and provide API to use them directly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * That said, there are times when you cannot extend a particular class (usually
 * because you must extend a different class instead). In that case, you can
 * still implement the {@link Command} interface and end up with a perfectly
 * serviceable command. The consequence is only that other Java programmers will
 * not be able to use the latter paradigm above to invoke your code in a fully
 * compile-time-safe way.
 * </p>
