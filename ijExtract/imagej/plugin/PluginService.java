/**
 * Interface for service that keeps track of available plugins.
 * <p>
 * The plugin service keeps a master index of all plugins known to the system.
 * At heart, a plugin is a piece of functionality that extends ImageJ's
 * capabilities. Plugins take many forms; see {@link ImageJPlugin} for details.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default plugin service discovers available plugins on the classpath.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <em>plugin</em> is distinct from a {@link imagej.module.Module} in that
 * plugins extend ImageJ's functionality in some way, taking many forms, whereas
 * modules are always runnable code with typed inputs and outputs. There is a
 * particular type of plugin called a {@link imagej.command.Command} which is
 * also a module, but many plugins (e.g., {@link imagej.tool.Tool}s and
 * {@link imagej.display.Display}s) are not modules.
 * </p>
