ImageJ Mobile

IJ_Mobile is fully working android project. Features are limited to ImageCalculator, PlotProfile, and Measure.
ImageCalculator and Measure are based upon ImageJ2's code.
Image I/O is handled by Bio-Formats and stbi.
AChartEngine is used to plot data for PlotProfile.


ijExtract contains java files extracted from ImageJ2 and ImgLib2 that do not contain java.awt class.

IJ_Test1 is an old working android project, same base as IJ_Mobile just before radical restructuring and writing.

ImageJ2 is a non-android project for desktop to test out different functions and work around classes to later put on mobile.
